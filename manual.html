    <h2>!!DISCLAIMER!!</h2>
    <p>This bot only saves the gameplay and decoration parts of the collabs. You can manually save verifiers, mergers, etc. but you cannot enter its data here as the bot will freak out.</p>
    <div class="command">
        <h3>!setserverdata [host user id] [gp judge role id] [deco judge role id] [judge channel id] [error channel id]</h3>
        <p>This command should be the first command to run. Turn on developer mode to add an id of the channels, roles and user ids. This command can ONLY BE USED BY THE CREATOR OF THE SERVER.</p>

        <h3>!create [collab name (do not add spaces)] [collab host id (only one)] [gameplay role standard] [decoration role standard] [standard type] [amount of gameplay parts] [amount of deco parts] [song name (no spaces)]</h3>
        <p>This command can only be used by the host of the collab team the server creator has set.</p>
        <p>Upon creation, the bot will create a catergory for the collab, an info channel, a finished channel (for finished parts) and a progress channel only visible to the people who joined the parts</p>
        <p>If your collab name has multiple words, use underscores instead of spaces (or use camel casing).</p>
        <p>Standard type can only be "binary" or "tiers" in all lowercase. Tiers indicate that there are tiers on standards, and the person joining must be higher or equals to the role you set in [gameplay role standard] and [decoration role standard]. Binary indicates the collab can be joined if you have the roles you set in [gameplay role standard] [decoration role standard]</p>
        <p>If there is no deco parts or gameplay parts, put a 0 in the said standards and put 0 on how many said parts there are.</p>
        <p>Upon creation of the channels, feel free to change the names of the catergories and channel to fit your liking.</p>
